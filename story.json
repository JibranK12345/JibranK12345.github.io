        "story": "There’s a boat, somewhere, drifting by itself in the ocean. On busy days, waves extend endlessly in all directions, but, on silent nights, the water acts like a bedsheet, a smooth cover concealing the mysteries of the dark ocean underneath. Pitch, pitch, black, the water, it’s eerily dark and hides its secrets under lonely reflections. Light shimmers throughout the sky, sometimes, providing some insight into the surroundings. But, the boat is only really guided when the moon is round and the waters quiet. There’s a boat, somewhere, drifting with a little girl. She’s not lost, because that would imply she had somewhere to go; instead, she just exists, floating by herself in her magical rowboat. She usually wears a yellow raincoat because it gets rainy, but even when it’s bright she leaves the coat on as it matches the sun. Whenever pangs of hunger hit, the little girl reaches underneath a bench and pulls out whatever meal the boat decides for the day. When she’s sleepy, she crawls underneath the covering and naps as the rowboat warms her dwelling. When she’s bored, she knocks on the sides of the boat and listens to the songs it plays. There’s a boat, somewhere, drifting with an old man. He’s not lost, because that would imply he had somewhere to go; instead, he just exists, floating by himself in his broken rowboat. He usually wears a suit, but occasionally he changes into something more comfortable. When he’s hungry, he reaches into the waters and tries to grab at fish; usually, his hands are too slow and he can only find morsels of plants to eat. When sleep overtakes him, the man places a towel under the rotten bench and enjoys what little sleep he can. Naturally, the man gets bored, but there’s nothing he can do, really, except stare out into the endless depths, imagining what untold stories the waters keep. There’s two boats, somewhere, drifting until they pass by each other. There’s a person in each, but neither are lost, because that would imply they had somewhere to go; instead, they just exist, floating by themselves until they come close for a few moments. The old man yells out to the girl, trying to get her attention, but the girl can’t hear. She’s sleeping, as the boat lulled her to sleep for the night. The man screams and cries, begging for her to wake up, but the magical rowboat keeps drifting forward, without direction, until the man can no longer see it. Finally, the old man gives up, rests his head under the rotted boards, and tries his best to sleep for the night. There’s a boat, somewhere, a magical rowboat, drifting endlessly into the night. Sometimes it turns around and sometimes it plays music. Sometimes, the boat produces food, too, but sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes, the boat becomes less magical, until it’s just a regular, ordinary rowboat. There’s a boat, somewhere, drifting with a girl. She’s not lost, because that would imply she had somewhere to go, but she is alone, on her ordinary, quiet rowboat, in the middle of an endless ocean."

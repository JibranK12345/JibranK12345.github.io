        "story": "I see blue all day. Everywhere I go, I feel the blue. The blue isn’t just the hue, plain and simple, but the ambience; a covert, blue shade. I feel it from my laptop screen and I feel it from my phone, from my television, from everything. I feel blue. Even when the blinds are closed and the room is dark, my laptop still screams out it’s blueness from its screen and so I return to it. And now, all day, every day, my eyes are filled with blue. I’ve tried turning off the blue but then I’m left with transparent thoughts. I think I’d be better with blue. Not really, though. That’s a lie because transparent thoughts are probably better for myself but they’re too boring so I prefer some entertaining blue. And I’m filling my ears with blue, now, too; not blues, not sadness, just anything to fill my ears and my eyes and when I take a break I think I’d rather return to the blue. I just want orange or yellow or green or summer time colors now but it’s only blue. At least it’s blue, I suppose, and not sick browns or bloody reds or anything of the sort. At least it’s just boredom. If you’re feeling blue it’s bad but if you feel like the sky or the ocean it’s great so maybe I could imagine my blue that way. Not jazzy blues but ocean blues and quiet blues and lapping blues. Perhaps that would work, calming, quiet, waves sprinkled between your toes. It’s a more relaxed blue, for sure, but I can’t fully feel it right now. Or at all, really. Maybe the sky blue would work. Open, long, meadows extend endlessly. Dandelions and sunflowers, the stuff of dreams and internet pictures with endless boundaries and infinite hills. That blue is so optimistic. Energetic, too. But I don’t feel those meadows right now because everything is flat and perpendicular, not rolling. I don’t know what I’m constantly checking my phone for or whose text I’m expecting. I return to my phone religiously, as if it contains someone not blue, but I imagine a lot of people are feeling this same blue in quarantine and no one from my phone would feel much different, I think. It’s not depression or sadness or anything like that, it’s just repetition and the same hues every day. Maybe an ocean was too big, too vast, too lofty of a goal to achieve right now. Let’s focus on a river. Actually, let’s start with a small stream. Whenever there’s a forest around a stream it’s usually pretty quiet, at least in stories. Like a quiet house, a quiet forest. And there’s a few animals, but not many, because that’s how the stories usually go. So it’s just a quiet, slow, blue stream. If you look right down on it it’s transparent, too, but mainly blue but it’s so peaceful. Can you feel the water, please. Rippling. It’s rippling. Cool, cool, blue water. It’s you, I’d imagine, blue but peaceful and serene. Can you sit on this rock, it’s all cool and comfortable, take a seat and dip your feet in the blue. Nap a bit, if you’d like, no one’s here to disturb you. And when you wake up you’ll still be on this rock, still blue, but beautifully blue. Of course, maybe you do miss someone or something or people or events in this forest but let yourself enjoy this serenity. Dip your feet in this beautiful, blue, blue stream, for once."

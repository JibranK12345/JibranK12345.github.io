Not inexpensive flowers, but cheap flowers — expensive flowers can be very, very cheap, if you get them from the wrong place. I hate lies, so naturally (and I say this with care) I hate cheap flowers.And they might be the prettiest flowers you’ve ever seen, and I have no doubt they’d fill your arms and leave a trail of petals everywhere you walked. What a lucky person you must be, receiving such an extravagant display of someone’s love. I still despise them.You know, the worst part is how cheap flowers are given. Not physically, nor in the words that are exchanged; in fact, you could even give cheap flowers while telling someone you love them! Cheap flowers are hasty, transactional, like dropping an envelope in a mailbox — here, let me deposit these roses so I can forget about them. I hope they arrive somewhere good. Or not.The worst part about cheap flowers is how pretty they are. It would be disrespectful to let something so alive wither, so cheap flowers always receive water and sunlight, and once a day, or twice, or maybe even on multiple occasions, they’ll receive undeserving glances of admiration.It might appear that I’m suggesting real flowers must be hand picked, that if something is expensive it becomes inauthentic — not at all, in fact, lovely flowers, the sweet kind, could be overflowing bouquets or even a clump of dandelions on the side of the road. For instance, they could be given with “These reminded me of you” or even shoved in someone’s hands, perhaps with “I know how much you like sunflowers” or even on napkins, absentminded tulips meant to be erased.Cheap flowers are lies. They’re the prettiest thing I could find, so perhaps they can serve as a substitute for my love. "

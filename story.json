        "story": "When I was trying to imagine what I’d write about this weekend, I had a lot of different ideas. For some reason, I kept thinking of Arizona mountains, my empty streets past dusk, and the ending of Ramadan. Because, you see, I’d take the trash out on Thursday night, usually after dinner. After dinner, of course, the sky would be dark. And, at this late time, my suburban streets lay barren. On this particular Thursday night the air was cool; it had rained all day and now the street lights reflected off puddles in the street. To be honest, it was the first time I left the house in a while so the air felt comforting, as if it were massaging my skin. For some reason, my heart felt different. I can’t explain it precisely, but my heart felt comforted by the empty streets and crisp air, as if I was the only person alive on these desolate roads basking in cool Spring winds. And these lonely street lights reminded me of tall mountains in Arizona. If my memory serves correctly, I never climbed the mountains, but I can remember driving back from Arizona to Texas. The sky was dark then, too, and everyone was asleep except for my dad and me. The car was quiet, though, and the moon full; I rested my head on the cold windows and watched the comforting mountains roll endlessly by as we came closer to home. Back then my heart felt the same way as when I took the trash out, as if the mountains were running its hands through my hair as the entire world slept. The days of Ramadan are quickly fading away; this was my first Ramadan at home, where I fasted and prayed without mosques with sweaty rooms or basketball with broken hoops or food with forgotten friends, and, at first, I thought it was kind of lonely. More accurately, I kind of forgot about Ramadan, for a while, because there wasn’t anyone to see in real life, nor was there any elaborate Eid celebrations to look forward to. I mentioned Arizona mountains and empty streets, though, because I think I’m shifting the way I feel about Ramadan, now. With those empty, quiet, streets and drifting purple mountains I never felt alone. In fact, quite the opposite; my heart felt open, for some reason, and all lovely and sharp, perceptive to all different kinds of feelings. I don’t know what it was about then, nor do I know what it’s about now, but I’m starting to feel that way more often. It’s nothing sweet or anything to be romanticized, honestly, it’s just a different type of feeling. The feeling’s appreciative, I guess, of just living. And when you’ve finished eating Suhoor and lay in your bed at six in the morning, the feeling’s just peaceful and calm. Rays of sun slowly start to shine and birds begin chattering, eventually, until you doze off for some time. And it’s not like this is a constant feeling, either, that I feel every second of the day or some new epiphany of mine; no, not at all. It’s just the way I’ve shifted viewing Ramadan at home this year, where the lack of socializing made the fasting all the more different and my heart all the more open. Tenderness, I guess you could call it sometimes. The point of writing this wasn’t really supposed to be about me. Instead, it’s for those people whose Ramadan has been filled with loneliness, whose quarantine is empty and desolate of interaction. All those feelings are real, and nothing at home is the same. Sometimes, though, I think we can appreciate time by ourselves and indulge in just being alone and let our hearts grow a bit more tender this quarantine."

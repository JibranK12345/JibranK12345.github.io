        "story": " November feels like Thursday. One, it just naturally feels like a Thursday, but more importantly it feels like it’s always here again. December comes, Spring disappears, and Summer floats away until we’re here again; not fall, not October, but November. It felt like it was just warm; the trees were only just starting to golden. But the leaves are on the ground now, the wind now a tad bit chiller. Fall is almost over now and there’s only anticipation for the warmth of winter interiors. November is anticipation, that’s why it’s Thursday to be honest. You know, there’s a reason why I’m writing about November. I don’t remember if these moments were November, exactly. Actually, I think they were January or February to be honest but I still feel like they’re November. It was the strolls and the night walks. Walking somewhere, or, even better, walking nowhere, with a cap covering my ears and my hands tucked away in my pockets. The sky is all dark and November mutes any sounds so you can clearly hear any of your footsteps. It’s a nice night walk, a leisurely exploration, a reflective stroll through whatever empty streets you find. And I know for a fact this wasn’t just in November; it was in Chicago Octobers and any winter and even any January, but I’d still like to think it was November. The cold feet, I think that’s how November makes me feel, like wearing socks over cold feet. Wearing socks inside, wearing two layers of blankets, and wearing sweatshirts, I think that’s November. But November is also watching. It’s before the holidays, before people give gifts. It’s the time to watch commercials, to see what products you want, to imagine what presents you’ll be receiving this year. It’s Black Friday, it’s watching someone getting the television you longed for so badly. It’s watching others, maybe, for a lot of people, November tends to be lonely. November is comparison, I’d imagine. The months start to conclude, too, and the fall leaves start to melt away into ice and jackets, transitioning into something new. And the year is over, too, now, and December is merely a formality, an extra couple of days to wrap everything up and tie any loose knots. November is transitioning into conclusion. But I like November. November is sweet, it’s cold but only just a little and November isn’t a winter snowstorm. November is just a calm chill, a really peaceful night stroll. November is sleepy naps, too, after battling the light chill outside. November’s pretty cool. "

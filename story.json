        "story": "(Make sure to turn on notifications so you won't miss future stories).  There was a bakery somewhere by the beach. It’s not particularly important where the beach was but every day, sometime before sunset, orange and yellow rays would start to stream through the blinds and illuminate floating specks of dust. It wasn’t a dirty bakery, no, it was quite well taken care of, but surfers and children and office people and busy workers would walk in with their dirty clothes to buy pastries throughout the day so, naturally, the bakery had floating specks of dust. The pastries weren’t that great anymore. They tasted fine, honestly, but only something slightly beyond what you could find in your local grocery store. There was only one employee — she was sixty, maybe seventy, although some people guessed even eighty — who would make all the pastries. She’d always arrive before sunrise, some time around four a.m., and start baking the treats for the day. It was dark outside. Not depressingly so, but a dark blue type of night sky dark. She left the front door open and began her baking. Every so often she would pause in front of the door and stare at the waves, frothy torrents of water slamming quietly in this twilight hour. Every once in a while she’d sit down too, wipe her forehead, wipe any strands of hair that had come loose, and catch her breath. And after she’d finish baking she’d exit the small shop and begin cleaning the two front windows. They were filled with empty cake stands as she hadn’t the time nor the energy to bake cakes; nonetheless, she still prided herself in their clarity. It was spraying specks of ocean water, as it usually was in the mornings, so she’d bring her plants inside, water them, and return them when the sun would start to rise. Around this time she’d return to her seat, cross her arms, and begin to doze away. She dozed off quite often, more than she’d like to admit, but this was the only sleep she’d get. The bells would finally ring, the office workers had arrived, so busy, so fast, so in demand for their pastries. They loved the raspberry strudels, so much so that they would tip the old lady even as she insisted not to. The surfers, for the most part, were polite. Their skin was tan, specks of freckles dotted here and there, and would order randomly. Sometimes they didn’t have money but the lady didn’t mind, the bakery wasn’t going to last for much longer anyways. Near noon the children would start to arrive. Their mothers would stand outside the front door and wave at the old lady as the kids rushed in with wads of sticky cash in their hands. She’d smile, give them their pastries, and watch as their mothers told them to wait until they were outside to eat. Slowly, the strands started to fall out quicker. She would catch them in her hair net, of course, but she had started to doze off while baking now, too. It was quite dangerous, everyone agreed, and the office workers and mothers and surfers lamented that someone really should do something for her. No one really did, though, and dust specks started to show more clearly, not because of the office people or children or busy workers but because the bakery was getting dusty now and the rays of sunshine only exaggerated this fact. Perhaps I should tell you another story. There was a sandwich shop somewhere by the beach.It wasn’t particularly important where the beach was though, as the children enjoyed the sandwiches as did the office people and busy workers and surfers, so the town was happy and life moved on in this speck by the beach. The windows were always dirty, for some odd reason, it seemed no one would ever clean them, but no one seemed to mind."

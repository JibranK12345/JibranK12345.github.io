        "story": " A few months ago, I wrote about love. I was hoping I could containzerize it, that I could pass it onto you in a ziplock bag, but really the effort was futile. Maybe I was hoping I could open the ziplock bag whenever I wanted, reach my hand in, and just take out a scoop. At the end, I realized I was only describing colors to a blind person. But now I hope I can containerize happiness; I hope I can pack it nicely, in a pretty white box with a red bow, and hand it off to you to take with you on your journey. Are you sad? Why are you sad? Is it something, perhaps, that you missed out on something? Maybe you lost a necklace. Maybe it was a watch, or a television deal you missed out on. Is that why you’re sad, over an object? Is that something an emotion? Are you missing an emotion? You can tell me, I’m here to listen. Is it contentment, or satisfaction? Is it purpose? Are you missing purpose? Is that why you’re sad, over missing an emotion? Is that emotion a person? Are you missing someone? Is that what it is? I promise I won’t tell anyone, honestly. Who could it be, perhaps a family member? Did someone pass away? If so, I’m so terribly sorry. Was it a friend? Are they still alive? Are they gone? Is that why you’re sad, over missing someone? Is that person an event? Were they part of events, memories, images of the past? I wonder if a person could be an event. Is that what it is, that they remind you of times and things and contexts long gone? Is that what you’re sad about, events in the past? Is that event an emotion? Does it give you comfort, imagining moments from those seasons? Is the snow gone, now, or maybe it’s the sun that’s not shining as brightly, you’d have to tell me as it’s your story really. The music, perhaps that played nicely at the time, or perhaps the sleepiness or the coolness or the stillness of the moments. Is that what you’re sad about, emotions in the past? Is that emotion something, perhaps, that you missed out on something? Is that why you’re sad, that you lost something? Maybe it was a watch or a necklace or contentment or satisfaction or purpose or support or a person or an emotion or a memory, maybe that’s what you lost that makes you so sad. You can think about it. Did you not lose anything? Is there nothing making you sad, nothing you can think of, but the happiness still isn’t there — can I just give you this box to take with you on your journey, just in case you figure out what it is? Is that fine with you? I wonder what I could put in this box. It’s empty right now, but let me take off the lid so we can fill it together. It’s a nice box, like the type of boxes they put expensive chocolates in. There’s no chocolates, of course, as the box is empty. Let’s walk through the aisles together and fill the box, one item at a time. But the aisles are empty. I don’t know why, I promise you they were filled a few moments ago with the prettiest of things, but now that we’re here there’s nothing to fill this box with. This wasn’t supposed to happen, though, this was supposed to be the nice part, I really don’t know what happened now. We would put whatever we liked in this box and then I would tie the red bow and hand it off to you, but everything’s gone now and it’s all empty. I don’t think you need the box, though, really and truly. I’m not just saying this because the aisles are empty or the shelves barren, but really and honestly and I promise you, I’m telling the truth, the box was just a sham. There wasn’t anything in this store, really, I was just trying to make a commission off you, I’m so terribly sorry, most of the things in the store were made of glass, anyways, and pretty fragile if you ask me. Look, I know you don’t believe me, and I know the box was really pretty, but I’ve been working here for years now; the box was all just a lie. You don’t need it. This store, as you imagined it, was just make believe all the time, a house of imaginary glass figures that you never needed. Can you leave, now, please, and no, I can’t give you the box, it’s just a chocolate box like I said, there’s nothing here and there’s no real box and there was nothing on these shelves but fragile glass figures that broke too soon anyways."

        "story": " There are cows around you, everywhere, some sleeping and some grazing and some walking mindlessly in circles. You’re sitting, your hands covered in dirt and your jeans wet from some mud from some place from some time before you got here; you’re here now, with the cows in the night under a comforting blanket of stars. That’s all that matters now, right?. They’re so mindless, aren’t they, just walking in this meadow. They don’t care about anything, nor did they ever, but the cows are still so peaceful, striding through the same strands of grass that cover you as the night seeps on. And you start to doze off now, just you in this endless meadow. It’s quite alright; the cows don’t hurt, and for the most part they’ll all be sleeping soon anyways. Listen to them, they’re quiet and soothing and don’t mind you here one bit. You’re the only person for miles, if I’m being honest with you. Quite frankly, I don’t even know how many; this isn’t a farm, it really is just some meadow in some country that no one remembers. It’s fine, though, and I want you to understand that and enjoy this meadow. Close your eyes, I promise it will be just fine. Look, you’re a bit confused, I get it. I don’t know how you got here either but look, trust me, the stars are so pretty. They’re so nice, aren’t they? Maybe there’s no one nearby but the stars, yes, the stars, they’re dotted like you’ve never seen with anyone before. They’re freckles sprinkled in every direction on this swirly black canvas. There are no light bulbs, no street lights, no televisions or phones, so I imagine you’d think it’s dark and scary but really it’s something so nice under these stars and not too dark, either, I promise if you’ll trust me you’ll see for yourself. I’m just the narrator, though, so I can’t really experience it myself. You’ll have to appreciate it yourself which I’m sure you’re more than capable of. It’s a bit chilly now. A jacket would be nice, or even a sweatshirt, but if you lay close enough to the ground it’s warmer. Enjoy the warmth and the ground and all the grass and the sky and the cows, they’re all here for you. Snow starts to float down, very slowly though, one snowflake at first, then two, and now the snow is starting to pick up. The cows still pace back and forth but they’re dotted, now, fuzzy with freshly fallen snowflakes. It is quite cold but I don’t want you to think about that right now. Stick your tongue out, really, honestly, just try it out and see if you can catch a snowflake. Did you do it? Did you catch one? Is it nice and cold and melting on your tongue? Is the snow in your hair now, actually, I imagine it is by now. The scene is so pretty, though, and I don’t want you to feel sad about the coldness or the flakes. I don’t know how you got here either, quite truthfully, I’m just now meeting you and just as confused as to how you got here. Don’t fret though, I’m sure these moments will be some of your most memorable. It’s quite beautiful, really. Close your eyes now. It’s getting late and even the cows have stopped pacing. They’re sleeping, all of them. You’re not alone, I promise, the cows will keep you company tonight and even when they’re gone, when the cows roam off to someplace far from you, the stars will come back the next night and I promise the sky and this meadow will take good care of you. I promise."
